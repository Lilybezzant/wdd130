                The pictures shown below have been a huge part in the creation of what has made the art world. The way that
                these creations have continued to progressively increase what we know in the world of art and how it's been

                This photograpgh shows of lunch time on top of a skyscraper in New York City of 1932. As the fearless
                construction workers sat a top a rod with no fear of falling. They helped in the building of the Rockfeller
                and yet a skyscraper seems like nothing! They've remained un-identified yet will still remain icons because
                they gave us this photo!

        <h2>A Starry Night!</h2>
        <div>
            <p>
               The Starry Night is a well known oil-painting by the one and only, Vincent Van Gogh. Painted From
            the view of his east-facing window of his asylum. Only painted just before the sunrise to get a crisp
        depiction of the night. </p>

               Many pieces of art such as these have a large impact on the economy whether we realize it
            or not! We can find the most inspiration through these types of pieces of art that have many meanings
        behind them! </p>
